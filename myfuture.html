                <p>i have planned my future to be a cyber security and AI developer because I like new technologies and feel that AI can develop continuously and help people in the present or future to be more convenient and save a lot of time. As for cyber security, I think it is an important career that organizations need and has a high salary, so I want to be good at it and get this job.</p>
                <p>And I have planned my side career. I want to be a content creator about study, such as study vlog or anything productive because I am passionate and it is my hobby. Now I am starting a studygram as an account where I will post anything about my studies on <span>ig : inmistynight</span></p>
